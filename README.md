<h1>Hi, I'm Yun ‚Äî <br/>Data Scientist & Business Analyst</h1>

I turn messy data into clear decisions. My work spans optimization, forecasting, and geospatial analytics with a strong focus on business outcomes and reproducibility.

---

## üß≠ What I Do
- **Analytics for decisions:** translate models into actionable recommendations for ops, finance, and policy.
- **Reproducible science:** clean, documented notebooks + clear READMEs.
- **End-to-end projects:** data ingestion ‚Üí modeling ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí business narrative.

## ‚≠ê Academic Projects

### 1) NSW Milk Distribution Optimization (Gurobi, MIP)
Optimized distribution-center placement and routing across NSW to minimize total costs under capacity and coverage constraints. Solved a large MIP (16k+ binaries) and identified an optimal set of DC locations with quantified savings.  
**Tech:** Python, Gurobi, MIP modeling, scenario analysis  
**Repo:** `milk-distribution-optimization` (code, model files, report, result visualizations)

### 2) Stock Volatility Forecasting (HAR-RV, XGBoost)
Built and compared HAR-RV and ML models to forecast realized volatility from high-frequency features; evaluated with MAE, RMSE, R¬≤, and QLIKE. Final selection balanced accuracy and interpretability for stakeholder communication.  
**Tech:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost), time-series features, error analysis  
**Repo:** `volatility-forecasting-hf` (data prep, model training, metrics dashboard)

### 3) Great Barrier Reef Bleaching Modeling (GIS + ML)
Combined environmental predictors with spatial ML to classify bleaching severity across regions; delivered maps and PDP/SHAP-style explanations to support conservation decisions.  
**Tech:** R (caret, randomForest/e1071), spatial joins, cross-validation, interpretability  
**Repo:** `gbr-bleaching-ml` (R project, reproducible pipeline, maps)

### 4) Data Wrangling & Reporting Labs
Selected labs demonstrating robust data cleaning, feature engineering, and report automation (HTML/PDF).  
**Tech:** Python/R, Quarto, tidy workflows  
**Repo:** `analytics-labs` (curated notebooks + write-ups)

## üß™ How I Work
- **Clarity first:** each repo has a business context, assumptions, and limitations.
- **Reproducibility:** environment files, seed control, and step-by-step READMEs.
- **Communication:** visuals + executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders.
