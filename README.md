<h1>Hi, I'm Yun ‚Äî <br/>Data Scientist & Business Analyst</h1>

Hi, I‚Äôm Yun ‚Äî a recent graduate from the University of Sydney in Data Science & Business Analytics.
I turn messy data into clear decisions, with experience spanning optimization, forecasting, and geospatial analytics. The projects below showcase my academic work, where I focused on delivering business impact through rigorous analysis, clear communication, and reproducible workflows.

---

## üß≠ What I Do
- **Analytics for decisions:** translate models into actionable recommendations for ops, finance, and policy.
- **Reproducible science:** clean, documented notebooks + clear READMEs.
- **End-to-end projects:** data ingestion ‚Üí modeling ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí business narrative.

## ‚≠ê Academic Projects

### 1) NSW Milk Distribution Optimization (Gurobi, MIP)
Optimized distribution-center placement and routing across NSW to minimize total costs under capacity and coverage constraints. Solved a large MIP (16k+ binaries) and identified an optimal set of DC locations with quantified savings.  
**Tech:** Python, Gurobi, MIP modeling, scenario analysis  
**Repo:** [Milk-Distribution-Optimization](https://github.com/yun-522/Milk-Distribution-Optimization)
 (code, model files, report, result)

### 2) Stock Volatility Forecasting (HAR-RV, XGBoost)
Built and compared HAR-RV and ML models to forecast realized volatility from high-frequency features; evaluated with MAE, RMSE, R¬≤, and QLIKE. Final selection balanced accuracy and interpretability for stakeholder communication.  
**Tech:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost), time-series features, error analysis  
**Repo:** [Stock Volatility Forecasting](https://github.com/yun-522/Stock-Volatility-Forecasting.git) (data prep, model training, metrics dashboard)

### 3) Great Barrier Reef Bleaching Prediction (Interdisciplinary Data Science Capstone)
Developed predictive models to assess coral bleaching severity across northern, central, and southern zones of the GBR, in collaboration with marine science students. My contributions included first-version model development on the full dataset, presentation of results, creating the project schematic, and writing the Results ‚Äì Part A (Data) and Part B (Modeling) sections of the report. Models were compared (SVM, Ordinal Tree, etc.) across regions; key predictors identified included temperature, pH, nitrogen concentration, and salinity. <br>
**Tech:** R (caret, randomForest, e1071, ggplot2), SHAP/PDP visualizations, geospatial data integration<br>
**Repo:** gbr-bleaching-ml (R scripts, schematic, reports, maps)

### 4) Greater Sydney ‚ÄúBustling Index‚Äù (Spatial Data Science Workflow)
Designed a spatial analytics pipeline to measure how ‚Äúbustling‚Äù neighbourhoods across Greater Sydney are, by integrating multiple datasets (population, transport stops, polling stations, schools, businesses, parking meters, and taxi ranks). My role focused on Task 1 (data ingestion & cleaning) and Task 2 (metric design & scoring), including developing a z-score based index of well-resourced neighbourhoods. <br>
**Tech:** PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Python (pandas, geopandas), SQL, spatial joins<br>
**Repo:** greater-sydney-bustling-index (ETL pipeline, SQL schema, score analysis)

### 5) CPI Time-Series Forecasting (Inflation Modeling)
Built multiple-step-ahead forecasting models for quarterly CPI data, evaluating accuracy with mean squared error (MSE). Implemented and compared ARIMA and ML-based approaches to forecast 2022‚Äì2023 test values from historical CPI (1997‚Äì2021). Final submission achieved accurate forecasts and emphasized clear documentation and reproducibility. <br>
**Tech:** Python (pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn), time-series modeling, ARIMA, forecasting evaluation<br>
**Repo:** cpi-forecasting(https://github.com/yun-522/CPI-Time-Series-Forecasting-.git) (notebooks, forecast CSVs, MSE evaluation)

## üß™ How I Work
- **Clarity first:** each repo has a business context, assumptions, and limitations.
- **Reproducibility:** environment files, seed control, and step-by-step READMEs.
- **Communication:** visuals + executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders.
